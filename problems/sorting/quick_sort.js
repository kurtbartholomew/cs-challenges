/*
  Given an array of n unsorted and potentially duplicate
  integers, create an algorithm to sort these integers
  from smallest to biggest recursively with two steps:
  
  1 -- Choose a value from the array. That is the pivot value --
  2 -- Divide the array into subarrays based on the pivot value --
  3 -- Merge back together --

  Example: [7,5,9,12,15,2,4,10]
  Returns [2,4,5,7,9,10,12,15]
