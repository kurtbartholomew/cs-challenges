/*
  Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1

  This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).

  1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
  2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
  3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
  4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001
  So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001

  Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the 32 bit number: 2149583361

  Write a function int32ToIp(int32) that takes a 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address
