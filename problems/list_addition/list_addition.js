/*
  Given two lists representing integers, add the
  integers together and create another list.
  Each list node represents a single digit in the respective
  number. Write two functions, one to add the lists
  together if they are forward and one if they are backwards.

  Example (Backward): (6) -> (5) -> (4) -> (9),
                      (1) -> (7) -> (2) -> (3)
  Returns             (7) -> (2) -> (7) -> (2) -> (1)

  Example (Forward): (9) -> (4) -> (5) -> (6),
                     (3) -> (2) -> (7) -> (1)
  Returns     (1) -> (2) -> (7) -> (2) -> (7)

  Constraints: Assume all inputs will be the same length.
               All inputs are 9 or under.
